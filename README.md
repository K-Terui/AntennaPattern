# AntennaPattern
Calculate array factors and plot directivity patterns of array antenna

## Examples
Uniform and binomial arrays were prepared as array antennas. Let us illustrate these antenna patterns.  
We can calculate and plot the antenna directivity like this.
![antenna directivity](results/arraygain_dBi.jpg "directivity")

Also we can plot the antenna pattern in polar coordinates. (Note that the array gains are normalized here.)

### Notice
We consider the *uniform linear array (ULA)*.
If you want to apply this function to *uniform planar array (UPA)*, please calculate the elevation previously.
